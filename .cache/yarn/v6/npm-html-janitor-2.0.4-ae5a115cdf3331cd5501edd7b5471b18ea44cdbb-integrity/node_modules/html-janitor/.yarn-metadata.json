In particular versions prior to 2.0.3 are vulnerable to XSS attacks.\nSee [here](https://hackerone.com/reports/308155) and [here](https://hackerone.com/reports/308158).\n\nPlease upgrade to 2.0.4 or above and consider building your own additional checks on user input.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nvar janitor = new HTMLJanitor(options);\n\nvar sanitisedHtml = janitor.clean(html);\n\n```\n\n### Options\n\nA configuration object.\n\n`tags` defines a whitelist of elements that are allowed in the sanitised output. Each entry in the map should be the name of the element and the attributes that a valid for the element.\n\nE.g. `{tags: { p:{}, a: { href: true} }}` would limit the valid HTML subset to just paragraphs and anchor tags. Paragraph tags would have all attributes stripped, and the anchor tags would only have the `href` attribute preserved.\n\n#### Blacklisting and whitelisting all attributes\n\nYou can set an element to be `true` to allow all attributes on an element and `false` to remove all attributes.\n\n#### Using logic\n\nIf you need to apply logic when determining whether to whitelist an element or an attribute, you can pass a function.\n\nHere's an example that removes all `<u>` elements that are empty.\n\n```\n    u: function(el){\n      // Remove empty underline tags.\n      var shouldKeep = el.textContent !== '';\n      return shouldKeep;\n    },\n```\n\nA function can also be used for attributes, only the attribute's value and the element are passed as the function arguments:\n\n```\n     img: {\n      height: function(value){\n        // Only allow if height is less than 10.\n        return parseInt(value) < 10;\n      },\n      width: function(value, el){\n        // Only allow if height also specified.\n        return el.hasAttribute('height');\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nFunctions may return any value that's accepted as a regular value, including an object:\n\n```\n     blockquote: function(el) {\n      if (el.classList.contains('indent')){\n        return { 'class': true, 'style': true }; // If blockquote has class 'indent', also allow style.\n      } else {\n        return {}; // Strip everything\n      }\n    }\n\n```\n\n\n## Distribution\n\nUses UMD for support in AMD and Common JS environments.\n\n### Not suitable for Node\n\nThis library is designed for use in a browser and requires access to [document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Document) and [createTreeWalker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createTreeWalker) to work.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install html-janitor\n```\n\n## Development\n\nTo run unit tests:\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm run test\n```\n",
